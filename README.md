## Comments

I used Alerts to edit notes. I assume notes will show string.
If I had longer text or more input to take care, I choose to navigate to separate screen. There you can add new note, edit etc. Similar to Notes app on App Store.
I didnâ€™t show any error with sending to user. It=s up discussion what user need know.
